# backup-storage
create and backup storage

This console app will create dummy table and blob storage containers. After creating these dummy tables and containers it will then populate
it with dummy data and blobs.

Every time it is run it will ad on to these tables and containers making your storage ever growing unless you delete it.

From here it will then attempt to backup the created tables and blobs into a backup storage account.
