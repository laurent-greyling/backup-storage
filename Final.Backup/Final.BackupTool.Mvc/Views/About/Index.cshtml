        <h3>About Azure Backup And Restore</h3>
        <p>The Backup tool can back up storage account blobs and tables on a periodic basis. A first run backs up all business-critical production data (domain blobs and tables) from the configured production account to the configured backup account. Each subsequent run is incremental for new and changed blobs, and performs full backups for tables. Note that backups of tables are stored as blobs in JSON format.</p>
        <p>An operational account stores tables that log the backup and restore operations performed. The operational account should not be configured to use a production or backup storage account. However, one operational account to list operations for all regions.</p>

        <h3>How To Use</h3>
        <p><b>NOTE</b>- Depending on the amount of data you have to restore or backup, this will be a long running process. 
            Although this site will run blobs and tables in parallel, and was optimised with TPL-Dataflow parallism, it can still take some time to finish.
        </p> 
        <h4>First Run</h4>
        <p>
            When you run this application the first time, you will be asked to supply an operational storage connection string. The connection string will be stored as a cookie to have the site run optimally.
        </p>
        <p>
            Some points to take not of
            <ul>
                <li>The operational account should not be the same as your production or backup account.</li>
                <li>This account is used to store status information on your backup and restore process</li>
                <li>This connection is needed to recover your production and backup information</li>
                <li>This storage should not be used to store business critical information</li>
                <li>The cookie is only valid for 5 days, there after the site will request you to remind him what it was</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>After you have set the connection the first time, you will be directed to where you can create your connection to storage groups</p>
        <h4>Add Group</h4>
        <p>The Connection Strings section is where you will provide the connection strings to:</p>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li>Group Name - name of your connection string group. For example Asia storage can be called AsiaGroup</li>
                <li>Production Storage account - The table and blobs which you would like to backup, or when you restore the account to which you want to restore to</li>
                <li>Backup Storage account - Storage you would like to restore from or backup into</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            Once you have supplied these connections and save then, they will be stored in the operational storage account and can be recovered by selecting the group you need to backup or restore.
        </p>
        <h4>Selecting your group</h4>
        <p>After you have succesfuly created a group you can now easily backup or restore</p>
        <p>In the backup and restore section, select your group that need to be backed up or restored. All groups will be shown in the dropdown list</p>
        <h4>Backup Section</h4>
        <p>This section is to backup what you have chosen:</p>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li>Backup Table - This will run backing up of tables</li>
                <li>Backup Blobs - This will run backing up of blobs</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            If both are set it will run both tables and blob backup.
        </p>
        <h4>Restore Section</h4>
        <p>This section is to restore what you have chosen:</p>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li>Container Name - This is the name of the specified container you wish to restore. If left blank all containers will be restored</li>
                <li>Blob Name - This is the name of the blob to be restored. If left blank all blobs within a container will be restored</li>
                <li>Table Name - This is the name of the table to be restored. If left blank all tables will be restore</li>
                <li>
                    Restore From and To Date - although not forced, this is a required field for restore to work properly.
                    This will make sure you retore the correct blobs or tables for the date you need.
                    Even if you want to restore the most recent, you will need to supply these dates.
                    If you are unsure to which dates and times, you can go to the <b>view log</b> section as the log for the date will contain the exact times you need
                </li>
                <li>Force option - this will allow you to force a blob restore. if this is not selected, only blobs that have been altered will be restored while others will be skipped</li>
                <li>Restore Tables</li>
                <li>Restore Blobs</li>
                <li>If both Restore Tables and Restore Blobs are selected all tables and blobs will be restored, irrespective of values filled into other inputs. Dates are still required.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            If both are set it will run both tables and blob backup.
        </p>
        <h4>Status Section</h4>
        <p>When the backup or restore is started a status page will appear. This page will give the following information:</p>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li>Operation Type - Full(All was restored or backedup), Incremental(only changed storage was restored or backedup)</li>
                <li>Copied - Number of blobs or tables copied. If zero, check if it was incremental</li>
                <li>Skipped - Usually greater than zero if incremental operation was executed</li>
                <li>Faulted - number of blobs or tables that did not backup or restore because of a fault, check logs</li>
                <li>Finished in - time it took to finish as days:hours:minutes:seconds</li>
                <li>Status - Finished, Skipped(if not selected), Executing(still busy with executing)</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

            If both are set it will run both tables and blob backup.
        </p>
